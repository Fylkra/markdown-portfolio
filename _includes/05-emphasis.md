 I am a voracious learner. I am currently starting to learn PinYin in _Mandarin_ and am truly loving the language. I feel very at home with the concepts and structure of _Mandarin_ so far. 
 
 I am also on the quest to master __C++__. I feel that this programming language is the one which I feel most at home at from the few I have sampled. I am amazed at the system which allows the language to continually evolve through an exchange of reason and empirical experiences. I am proud to consider myself a __C++__ Programmer.
